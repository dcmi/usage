# SRAP 2025-09-09 Review Minutes

* Attendees: Tom (co-chair), Argie (co-chair), Niklas (co-chair), Karen, Osma, Nishad, Phil, Antoine, Joe, Dan
   * Regrets: Sunny
* Agenda: https://github.com/dcmi/usage/blob/master/reviews/srap/meetings/2025-09-09.md

----

* Introduction by Tom
* Introduction round of participants
* Presentation of SRAP by Osma https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1f8UyCuObvvF3HWR_f_8mMi9DrprsYyapCXsYCQowNj4/edit?usp=sharing
    * Some elements do not have an existing property
    * 'srap:' as a temporary namespace (only to be made permanent as a last resort)
    * ? Should some elements be added to DC Terms, or to BIBO?
    * Diagram: focus is scholarly resource, with persons, organizations, books, and periodicals.

## Classes

Person: similar to foaf:Person 
* either, new dct class subclass dct:Agent
* or dct:Agent not subclassed
* also need *name* and *affiliation* for person
* and *role*

Organization: both foaf and schema have these
* either new dct class subclassed to dct:Agent
* or new dct class not subclassed to dct:Agent

Grant
* *funding* to link to grant
* seems to fit well into BIBO

srap:resource
* This would represent the focus entity
* perhaps add to bibo called *ScholarlyResource*

## Properties

* *url* - add to bibo
* some dates that are needed, may fit in with DC terms
* 


## Comments

### from Dan (from chat window)

> Re delta wrt bibo, at some point at schemaorg we made a set of additions/changes there to align it with Bibo. If a wider consensus has moved on, we could try to get that changed to match

> With https://schema.org/Grant and nearby, where things are similarish … it might be worth having a table listing known examples of situations where some entity might only belong to one of two similar-looking classes.

> Does the AP allow other systems for describing roles, beyond marc relators? I am thinking of modern scientific publications which have 1000s of authors/contributors. Maybe project or region specific shex/shacl could target modest variations on the AP approach, without the AP needing to anticipate everything?

Karen, to Dan:
> Dan, good question. And we could consider whether this should be a specific AP or if it’s being seen as a profile foundation for other profiles.

Osma, to Dan:
> @Dan Brickley for now it mentions only MARC relators, but I don't see why it couldn't be a bit more open.

Dan to Osma:
> @Osma Suominen that is the rdf dillema in a nutshell. We constantly open up variations to permit varied noble usecases. The idea of an App Profile was always a counterbalance to that, leaning towards specificity. I don’t know the answer! Except to think about clouds/clusters of APs, which seems unrealistic since there aren’t that many shex/shacl apps yet
 
Osma writes:
> @Dan Brickley Exactly. This has always been a problem for the SRAP WG as well. Like Karen said, are we making a specific WG or a foundation / base profile, to be refined by more specific profiles. I think we're mostly leaning on the foundation profile case because it's hard to agree on the specifics internationally
sorry, specific AP (not WG) Foundation/base imho

> We are in a new world now wrt machine understanding of diverse data, so we can more easily afford variations

> It is also the right moment to push for open public metadata for all scientific record, cultural heritage, everything…
 
## How to progress
* make a github issue for each proposal


## Calls

PROPOSED Second and fourth Tuesday of each month for 90 minutes.

## Use of issues

Argie: Github Project can link to issues in several repos (across repos). 

Antoine: Better to create SRAP issues in SRAP repo - involve WG in discussion. Better than putting something so specific in usage repo.

## Where to do the work?

Usage board or SRAP? (note: also BIBO)

Osma: all of the issues in the document for the board are for the Usage Board

## Level of detail

**From Dan**: "Does the AP allow other systems for describing roles, beyond marc relators? 

* should we find a way to make the DCTAP more open?

## Next steps

* Karen to add issues to SRAP folder, with link to this project
