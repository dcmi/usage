### bibo:organizationUnit
- https://github.com/dcmi/dc-srap/issues/82

Result from last time (lazy consensus awaiting this call in case there is strong opposition from non-attendees): name `bibo:organizationalUnit` APPROVED

Still open: definition, see https://github.com/dcmi/dc-srap/issues/82#issuecomment-3879225993, please vote

A: Ninety minutes today, as usual.
K: To me, OrganizationUnit is better, dropping "al".
O: Shorter is better. We had that discussion at some point. I proposed a long definition, then Karen a shorter.
K: I didn't pay any attention to Usage Note (which can be changed at will). Since we are defining in BIBO, mentioned that in DCTAP we have, for organization, allows either value shape (node) or literal. The DCTAP could be simplified for people doing key-value pairs. Those who want URIs, nodes, can do too. Designed for either-or.
Phil: In terms of BIBO proposal, ObjectProperty?
N: That is issue for other BIBO proposals. We can accept straw proposal and deal with broader issue in BIBO. 
Phil: Define range first, then let TAP tolerate literals, or design TAP first?
N: Postel's law. Gets complex: "let's do same for affiliation".
K: [looking for how it fits into SRAP] Where was it? Ah, it was "scholarlyUnit". Defined here as being node for organization. Some decisions will require us to rethink SRAP. Some not motivated by SRAP. Once we brought BIBO into it, changed greatly. SRAP was very DC Terms, even 1.1, in its beginnings - a bit beyond, with shapes - but we tried to avoid. SRAP was fairly linear.
T: Flat?
K: Contribution issue circle from top to bottom, adding shapes only where needed addl info. Were not trying to define a data structure.
O: Who is audience? We don't really know. Has changed so much since beginnings. Repo community with 1990s-style metadata.
N: From perspective of producer and consumer, I appreciate clarity but know pains where not have the data structures. "As little as possible but not less". Focus on specific kinds of info. From developers perspective - how much license to take? Easier to fill in the blanks. That's how I appreciate these profiles - they convey intent.
O: Kind of a target, not necessarily closely mapped.
Kalli: It will eventually have to change. Accommodate 1990s systems is hard.
Karen: Agree but assume most people do not understand bnodes, etc. Much data creation without reference from RDF.
N: RDF unfairly maligned, but talk of graphs more common today. XML does not have that level of clarity on its own. Easy to slip from intuitive talk of graph into bnode jargon. Even in RDF WGs. Hard to spot slippage. If not share domain model - shared mathematical substrate. Stop talking about what the graph depicts. Insulate domain experts from technicalities. Text vs node, literal vs bnode - do not want to address, but then surprises can happen. Karen's qst re: whether organizationUnit should refer to organization.
Karen: Must be allowed when BIBO property.
N: Scope note: "exemplified".
Karen: Organizatn shape in SRAP TAP today. We have as many shape as SRAP can handle. OWL had an annotation shape - could be either (node or literal).

DECISION
Osma's proposal - 8 upvotes.
See https://github.com/dcmi/dc-srap/issues/82#issuecomment-3952798398

J: Technical note on tradeoffs?
T: Great idea. Range of 1990s-flat, literal-tolerant, SRAP, BF (simpler to more complex).
Kalli: Will look at Sinopia profiles for BF scholarly.

### Add :versionType to BIBO
- https://github.com/dcmi/dc-srap/issues/85

N: Did we discuss elsewhere?
Karen: Jan pointed to NISO - not an RDF vocab. People could come up with other version types. If does not take node as value, people can do with they want.
N: Wondered whether dc:type would do - but too wide. Use in conjunction with dct:versionOf? Relevant to BIBO examples? See no reason not to define.
J: Is SRAP about more than journal articles?
Karen: Know a vocabulary about legislation - "first draft", "out of committee"...
J: Paradata discussions on data sets. 
Karen: Yes, look at data sets, where versioning important.
N: Property should be usable in.
Kalli: MD for repository that can define a different version.
Karen: In SRAP WG, discussed if this is just about thing in hand. It is complicated!
N: Abstractions in WEMI, but modeling over time is not explicit. The more concrete you get, the more stuck in time? We need a proposal.
Kalli: "Version Type"?
O: because COAR uses.
N: Appreciate Type - abstract. "Version category" would not improve. Non-circular definition.
Kalli: Seems straightforward. Great.
Phil: Refer to "life cycle". "Current status is draft... work in progress..."
Karen: People see "version", think "1", "2"... Something that tells us... life-cycle. Status. 
Kalli: Type is good.
O: NISO from 2008. But also 2024. Was public comment. Waiting for final. Draft is available. Could mine for language. https://groups.niso.org/higherlogic/ws/public/download/30742/RP-8-202x_NISO_Journal_Article_Versions_draft_for_public_comment.pdf/latest New version has more granularity. Iterations of a preprint.
Karen: They use some COAR-like things.
O: NISO from 2008 is oldest. COAR 2022 - RDF with URIs, but much the same. They all say "versions" and COAR says "version types". We should use same. Apply to non-journal things - tech reports...
J: Does this relate to editions? Version of record?
Phil: For BIBO, not specify what values should be. We already have three: datasets, scholarly works, legislation, teaching materials.
O: Osma "director's cut". "Digitally restore"...
Karen: Let's go broad and vague.
N: The status vocabulary in BIBO (not to be confused with "term status", which we want to drop.) Double-type as SKOS concepts. "Status of publication of document".
O: Could we just use BIBO "status" as is? Defines range of "document status". We would need to say that COAR-like stuff would fit.
Rioxx uses "coar_version" as an attribute name:

```
<dc:relation 
    rel="item"
    type="application/pdf"
    coar_type="https://purl.org/coar/resource_type/c_6501" 
    coar_version="https://purl.org/coar/version/c_970fb48d4fbd8a85"
```
See https://dcmi.github.io/bibo/#:status

N: Someone want to propose?

Phil: One status is "unpublished". If a "published" document can be.

bibo:status skos:editorialNote "We are not defining, using an enumeration, the range of the bibo:status to the defined list of bibo:DocumentStatus. We won't do it because we want people to be able to define new status if needed by some special usecases. Creating such an enumeration would restrict this to happen."@en

Karen: What means?
O: They are not specifying valid values, purposely.

### DCTERMS accessibilityNote
- https://github.com/dcmi/dc-srap/issues/79
- comment period has run out on 2026-02-22: https://github.com/dcmi/usage/issues/133 (ACTION 2026-01-27: Kalli to thank people for posting or writing (acknowledging))
- To avoid overlap and monitor actions, we listed contacts we approached on this spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oOMwy2Ms1ed77FDG67MO7FP9Pu2IfgUov8fW-hAKAm0/edit?gid=0#gid=0

We propose to briefly summarize the status but to let it sit for a bit more and push on with the "Contribution class" issue instead since we have some traction there.

ACTION: Tom and Kalli to discuss turning this into issues. Kalli will thank everyone now that comments are closed.

### BIBO "Contribution" class

- https://github.com/dcmi/dc-srap/issues/94 Contribution class, which has been condensed from / is related to:
  - https://github.com/dcmi/dc-srap/issues/89 Person or Affiliated Author
  - https://github.com/dcmi/dc-srap/issues/90 bibo:affiliation
  - https://github.com/dcmi/dc-srap/issues/84 bibo:role

Discussion on 2026-02-10 yielded:
- summary of open questions and some consensus: https://github.com/dcmi/dc-srap/issues/94#issuecomment-3878878482
- strawperson proposal trying to distill the consensus by Osma: https://github.com/dcmi/dc-srap/issues/94#issuecomment-3878940156

Previous actions taken by group members were:
- ACTION 2026-01-27: Karen to model in DCTAP, simplified -- started, see https://github.com/dcmi/dc-srap/issues/94#issuecomment-3869041749
- ACTION 2026-01-27: UB chairs try to collapse multiple issues into the one now created by Osma (including diagram): https://github.com/dcmi/dc-srap/issues/94
- ACTION 2026-02-10: Kalli to summarize the discussion up until now into a new proposal to vote on -- postponed because of ongoing discussion in issue #94

N: Main issue is 94. Karen re: diagrams?
Karen: Created something based on Phil's diagram. Issue: TAP is pretty linear. Diagram has person and contributor, but also grant, periodical, book. Grant goes to organization shape. Does it work to add them in here? Direction of arrows?
Phil: Arrows switched back and forth on last call. No circular left. Possible, but problematic. Want to distinguish different facets of person as contributor. If were to treat as person - good starting point. If constraints in shapes that not match usage - eg, describing people in other contexts.
Karen: Now, orgn can have affiliation. How SRAP intends affiliation. 
Phil: Can anyone misuse?
Karen: Sure! It happens.
O: Team name is shortcut; not listing 200 people in AI lab. Team is kind of orgn.
Karen: Often first name + et al.
N: Are these blocking issues? I think we are converging on proposal. Stratifies. References same node twice. Antoine commented that we reused contributor on the contribution - too much punning?
O: Agreed. Better to have another. bf:agent? But strange to cherry-pick just one property from BF.
Karen: Do not think we have resolved all my qsts. Orgn used not only for contributors. Funders, scholarly unit, publisher - define all as contributor.
Phil: Take "contributor" out - "person shape", etc.
Karen: In SRAP, how to connect resource / funder / orgn?
Phil: Funder point to orgn shape.
O: Capture extra info about contributors. Contributn mechanism can be used to say.
Karen: Distinction btw contributors / other roles. But funder is contributor.
N: Seen in BF. Not more unclear than dc:contributor vs publisher. With contributn node, how to know that. Publishing as activity could emerge. SRAP need not be troubled by.
Karen: Want to make clear in SRAP. Doesn't read: What's in BIBO? What's in DC? At least clear how works. Problem with dct:contributor - one of vaguest imagined.
Phil: How much of problem go away if dc:creator not contributor?
N: I would not flinch. Notion of "primary contribution".
Kalli: Stupid qst: If someone really wants that level of complexity, better served by BF.
Tom: Best to tell broader story that has spectrum between flat and complex (eg, Bibframe).
N: "SRAP does not lend itself to capturing". Frame in bigger picture. Constructs do exist.
Karen: I would like new diagram. I draw by hand. See bigger picture. DCTAP is not a UML diagram. Where to "put things".
Osma: Roles are generally more useful for contributors (e.g. illustrator, translator) who are not the primary creators.
N: Unsure of "role". If SRAP doesn't capture. Stepping into BF territory.

ACTION Osma new diagram.

O: Apart from naming, seems clear. Will try to get arrows pointing right.
N: LC roles subproperties of dc:contributor. Bunch in BIBO, like Editor. Can express direct relationship.
