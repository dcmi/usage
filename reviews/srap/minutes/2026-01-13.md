### DCTERMS accessibilityNote
- https://github.com/dcmi/dc-srap/issues/79

As of December, we are leaning towards putting `accessibilityNote` into DC Terms but only if we can follow a process to ensure that the accessibility community approves of our definition. Tom has proposed a review process in https://github.com/dcmi/dc-srap/issues/92 .

If we can agree on the process, and then on a definition to post for public comment (e.g., for 30 days), we could already start that public comment after the January 13 call.

Osma discussed straw proposal with colleagues at NLF, and they commented:
- https://github.com/dcmi/dc-srap/issues/79#issuecomment-3654514780
- https://github.com/dcmi/dc-srap/issues/79#issuecomment-3699092922

Notes/discussion:

TOM: We would post a news item to the UB and link to the GitHub issue.

KAREN: Can everybody open an issue? TOM: yes

KAREN: We probably need to reach out to a larger community. 

TOM: Maybe Osma's colleagues can help spread the info?

OSMA: Yes, and we have some contacts in the schema.org community.

APPROVED 2026-01-13: Members on the call approved the process for holding a public comment period on the `dcterms:accessibilityNote` proposal (https://github.com/dcmi/dc-srap/issues/92). Kalli agreed to serve as shepherd.

The following definition to be published for comment:
- https://github.com/dcmi/dc-srap/issues/79#issuecomment-3744960937

FOLLOW-UP after 2026-01-13 – newly opened:
- https://github.com/dcmi/usage/issues/133 – for public comment on dcterms:accessibilityNote
- https://github.com/dcmi/usage/issues/134 – for discussion of announcement text about the public comment to be posted as news on the DCMI channel

ACTION 2026-01-13: TOM to write to Liddy Nevile and head of W3C community group Matt Garrish to get their input; then to post news on the DCMI channel and note to UB as outlined above

ACTION 2026-01-13: KALLI to act as shepherd for this issue, and to write an email to relevant IFLA committee.

ACTION 2026-01-13: EVERYBODY to contact people concerned with accessibility and point them to this issue: https://github.com/dcmi/usage/issues/133

### Add :embargoDateRange to BIBO (or DCTerms)
- https://github.com/dcmi/dc-srap/issues/81

Please comment on this issue or, better, propose a new definition. I think we agree that the property name should end with `End` or `Start`, but it is unclear whether this should be limited to open access.

Notes/discussion:

OSMA: Is the end the last day of the restriction or the first day where it is freely available?

KAREN: We cannot anticipate how systems implement the availability, we just need to make it possible to document the metadata

KALLI: How to define embargoEnd without repeating "end"? 

PHIL: Still a problem with granularity – what will range be? Date? DateTime?

(ensuing discussion about granularity and fencepost issues)

Osma points to https://www.elsevier.support/publishing/answer/how-do-i-request-for-an-embargo-period

OSMA: "isn't published before a specific date and time"

NIKLAS: so should it be embargoedBefore?

ARGIE: We retreated from the positive phrasing because an ending embargo does not necessarily mean available to everyone.

OSMA: "Available" is less problematic than anything specifically associated with Open Access.

NIKLAS: Useful as subproperty of dcterms:available.

PHIL: Still not sold on "date"

KALLI: There are definitions that are called date and then allow for date, date/time, or a period.

How about "date or date/time" in the definition?

OSMA proposes strawvote https://github.com/dcmi/dc-srap/issues/81#issuecomment-3745091474

TOM: insert "is made available" to express that there is a transition?

ALL: no, let's leave it

7/7 upvotes for strawperson proposal

APPROVED https://github.com/dcmi/dc-srap/issues/81#issuecomment-3745091474

ACTION 2026-01-13: UB chairs to add this issue to issue https://github.com/dcmi/dc-srap/issues/91, noting that this property could be a subproperty of dcterms:available.
DONE – see https://github.com/dcmi/dc-srap/issues/91#issuecomment-3748377307

### Describing an author as an agent – or with an "agent profile"?

- https://github.com/dcmi/dc-srap/issues/89 Person or Affiliated Author
- https://github.com/dcmi/dc-srap/issues/90 bibo:affiliation
- https://github.com/dcmi/dc-srap/issues/84 bibo:role

As of December, we are leaning against describing authors simply with nodes of type `foaf:Person` because affiliations and roles can be mixed from different contexts when aggregated together. However, we also think that SRAP should be straightforward to use by metadata creators. Instead of `Agent` we are considering something like `AgentProfile`.

Please review the three related issues (above) to decide how to balance ease of use against ease of aggregation.

Notes/discussion (incomplete):

TOM: Bruce d'Arcus commented this issue on GitHub and stated that they decided to keep it simple at the time when BIBO was created -- see https://github.com/dcmi/dc-srap/issues/84#issuecomment-3744558883.

KAREN: So they did not go the route of contribution like in Bibframe? correct

KAREN: Other option would be to hold it all together with a blank node?

NIKLAS: That is orthogonal to the question, the concept of resource is the tricky part -- a blank node still does not restrict the statement to one context

KAREN: Either a blank node or an IRI between creator and person

NIKLAS: Difficult to say what you associate the role with; almost like a persona; pretty a much an n-ary relationship construct; could use Library of Congress relators as relationships

KAREN: notion of creator (person or organization) holds them together; agree with Bruce to not get overly complicated; maybe users of SRAP should create their own properties / extended AP if they need them, maybe we don't need to extend BIBO for that

NIKLAS: yes, maybe, it's just about the assumptions that our model opens up; then users would need reification to express more

TOM: In favour of modeling things more explicitly but not confident that we can create a model that is unambiguous for users; so rather err on the side of being simplistic

PHIL: role is more complex than LC relators -- could be on a level even below the relationship with the paper -- "created particular data set, executed this and that experiment for this research contribution, etc." (https://credit.niso.org/); maybe put person as subject, then offer an optional "hasSpecificRoleWrt", then resource as object, and link back to creator (?)

KAREN: In many cases role will not be specified at all

PHIL: That's why I propose this triangular model.

#### BIBO namespace document and use of `rdfs:isDefinedBy` (Tom)

Should we add new BIBO terms to the existing ontology document or create a new BIBO namespace document?

See discussion in

- https://github.com/dcmi/bibo/issues/3 – BIBO namespace document
- https://github.com/dcmi/bibo/issues/4 – BIBO use of `rdfs:isDefinedBy`

#### Review of already-approved BIBO terms for completeness

Please vote on the completeness of term descriptions for five new BIBO terms.
