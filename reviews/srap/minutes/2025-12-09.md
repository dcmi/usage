## Issues currently under review

### Add :dateRetracted to DCTerms (or BIBO)
- https://github.com/dcmi/dc-srap/issues/80

Strawman proposal
- https://github.com/dcmi/dc-srap/issues/80#issuecomment-3600260634
Votes as of 2025-12-09, 15:00 UTC: 5

With no objection, approved definition:
bibo:dateRetracted: Date on which a published resource is withdrawn from the published record.

Osma: Subproperty of date? Range?

Karen: Resolve that later.

ACTION 2025-12-09: Tom to create issue for clarifying BIBO issues across all decisions for additions to BIBO (eg, deciding subproperty and range assertions for additions) -- and listing the affected issues we already know about.

Karen: Note that Tom created https://github.com/dcmi/bibo/issues/3 -- "BIBO namespace document" -- relevant here.

------

### Add :embargoDateRange to BIBO (or DCTerms)
- https://github.com/dcmi/dc-srap/issues/81

Strawman proposal
- https://github.com/dcmi/dc-srap/issues/81#issuecomment-3616321395
Votes as of 2025-12-09, 15:00 UTC: 3

Phil: What is an embargo? Not just related to open-access.

Osma: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embargo_(academic_publishing) describes all meanings of relevance to academic publishing.

Kalli: In my experience, means no access, not even paid, except for access.

Osma: In my experience, paid users should have access.

Phil: Depends on type of publication, eg books.

Osma: Press releases cannot be published before. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_embargo

Argie: What was the WG intention?

Osma: Academic type, related to open access.

Nishad: In industry, may allow indexing without access. But see now in relation to open access. Publisher perks to attract subscribers. Get DOI before publication to ensure...

Karen: Maybe better to leave ambiguous, like many things.

Argie: "bibo:embargoEnd: Date before which access to a resource is or was restricted." Up to 7 votes now.

Niklas: Joe's version okay too - "The date prohibition(s) to access ends"

Kalli: "The date access restrictions end"?

Osma: How does this relate to `dcterms:available`? That could affect the definition. There might be reasons other than embargo when not available.

Phil: If intent is related to open access, might we say "Open access begins"?

Karen: In SRAP, we do not have anywhere where we can say "This is open access". "License" is more specific.

Phil: License = some CC license is clear. Without specific license, it is not open access.

Niklas: We add explicit licensing info.

Osma: As for definition, we already have generic "available", and proposed that "embargo end" would be subproperty.

Argie: Talk of "embargo" or "open access".

Phil: Definitions for embargo end do not say anything about open access.

Kalli: "Open access embargo?"

Argie: "Open access start"? Maybe we need to let this marinate.

Osma: Two options: talk about "open access" in scholarly sense, or "embargoes". But risks encroaching on "accessibility".

Phil: Could BIBO be extended with types of embargo?

Osma: "Open access" maybe too strict? 

Karen: If SRAP to be used in repos, may have preprints and other versions that have no restrictions. Expressed in "Rights" and "No embargo"?

Nishad: "Open access" and availability are two different things. Framework regulations. Must be careful.

In https://github.com/dcmi/dc-srap/issues/81#issuecomment-3632935493:
In discussion on call, we agree:
- Property name should end with `End` or `Start`.
- This is about open access.

Open issues:
- Subproperty of "available"?

Will revisit in January.

### Affiliation -- domain of Person or Affiliated Agent?
- https://github.com/dcmi/dc-srap/issues/89

Niklas: The hard part is capturing context of claims. Trying to avoid complexity. If we assume flat and simple data, we assume that properties... Class is not a general "Person".

Niklas: Want to avoid spelling out explicitly. Rather: hints to guide data merging.

Osma: Arguments to keep it simple, add some guidelines. But if we want to do more, Niklas proposal is good except name could, be AgentProfile or ContextualAgent. Either do nothing, or do something like Niklas proposal, with good name.

Karen: Connecting person with role and affiliation. Could become extra node in SRAP profile. Creator has a shape as object -- person, role, etc -- like what Niklas proposes. Would not be proper to use outside SRAP.

Phil: Problem with "role", aggregating. I have been affiliated with unis. But even name can change.

Niklas: Okay, this is blank node. Problem aggregating roles. `dc:creator` with `foaf:Person`. Would not want to add `bibo:role` with domain `foaf:Person`. BIBO is pretty flat, similarly to DC Terms. Define "affiliation" without this, but `bibo:role` with domain `foaf:Person`.

Karen: The role could be for just about anything. The plasterer.

Phil/Argie: We have issue for "role": https://github.com/dcmi/dc-srap/issues/84.

Niklas: Lean towards saying "affiliation"...

Phil: Like N's solution for when it matters, while keeping simpler option open.

Karen: Does any of this change SRAP? I believe not. We want affiliation, in BIBO (not DCT).

Niklas: Agree in general -- not affect SRAP much. A few sentences in SRAP?

Karen: An appendix? Audience: creators vs consumers of data. So creator of data is audience for SRAP -- not consuming.

Niklas: Use case of publisher who aggregates.

Karen: Not with SRAP. 

Niklas: Appendix would be enough.

Argie: Issue 88 was closed because we approved use of FOAF terms. Issue 89: Do we add affiliation to BIBO.

Niklas: Renamed issue 89 "Define the domain of affiliation and role: Person or Affiliated Agent" and added issue for `bibo:affiliation` (https://github.com/dcmi/dc-srap/issues/90).

### Add :role to BIBO
- https://github.com/dcmi/dc-srap/issues/84

------

### DCTERMS accessibilityNote
- https://github.com/dcmi/dc-srap/issues/79

Deferred to 2026-01-13.

Osma: Discussed with colleagues -- good comments. See https://github.com/dcmi/dc-srap/issues/79#issuecomment-3632589150 . I propose: ""A statement describing features or deficiencies of a resource that enhance or impede its usability and accessibility for a diverse range of users, including but not limited to individuals with disabilities or impairments. This may include assistive technologies, alternative formats or design choices that facilitate broader usage."

Tom/Phil: Cut after "accessibility" -- put rest in usage or scope note.

STRAWPERSON VOTE

Definition: A statement describing features or deficiencies of a resource that enhance or impede its usability and accessibility.

Usage Note: Applies to a diverse range of users, including but not limited to individuals with disabilities or impairments. This may include assistive technologies, alternative formats or design choices that facilitate broader usage.

Kalli: I like it. "Usability" hints at the technical issues.

Argie: I see nine upvotes.

Osma: Do we have agreement on DC Terms vs BIBO? In previous meeting: aiming at literal value, leaning to DC Terms, not a subproperty of description.

Phil: If we put in DC Terms, can avoid questions about domain and range - something more open needed, and BIBO pattern is to specify.

Karen: Could fit into DC Terms.

Nishad: DC Terms is most stable vocabulary in SemWeb. In textbooks. In Japan: DC Terms over Schema.org because of stability. Need to be careful. Translated. If propose something for DC Terms, need to prepare very well. Then make broader call instead of just Usage Board.

Argie: People on call leaning to DC terms but needs to be prepared.

ACTION 2025-12-09: Osma to discuss strawman with colleagues before January.
