### BIBO properties for SRAP
- https://github.com/dcmi/dc-srap/issues/74

__RESOLVED:__

We approve of SRAP's use of properties and classes from the BIBO namespace in the SRAP profile.

These include, but are in principle not limited to, the terms bibo:Book, bibo:eissn, bibo:isbn, bibo:issn, bibo:issue, bibo:Journal, bibo:pageEnd, bibo:pageStart, bibo:Periodical, bibo:presentedAt, bibo:volume.

[Status as of Nov 11](https://github.com/dcmi/dc-srap/issues/74#issuecomment-3456355328): Eight votes in favor.

Tom: We can declare victory and close this issue.

------

### BIBO accessLink
- https://github.com/dcmi/dc-srap/issues/78

__PROPOSAL:__

bibo:accessLink

Definition: A link that provides the download location or access point for the scholarly resource.

[Status as of Nov 11](https://github.com/dcmi/dc-srap/issues/78#issuecomment-3457124226): Seven votes in favor.

Osma: We said it was going to be an IRI in the DC-TAP, so it seems it should be an owl:ObjectProperty.

Phil: The definition says it should be "a link to", so if we're nit-picky, it should perhaps be owl:DatatypeProperty, with rdfs:range xsd:anyURI?

Osma: In our example, it used a IRI reference (within `<...>` in Turtle).

Tom: Do we need to hold off declaring victory and discuss more?

Phil: If this is an ObjectProperty, we probably should take out the first words ("a link that provides").

Tom: We should probably discuss this more in the issue.

Osma: If we follow the design for bibo:uri, this should be a literal (DatatypeProperty).
... I'm switching my opinion to prefer accessLink to be defined as that too.
... I volunteer to make a new proposal.

Phil: Yes, we probably don't intend for this resource to be described further (with title, etc).

Tom: I suggest for Osma to make a new proposal, and to move on now.

__ACTION__: Osma to make a new proposal in https://github.com/dcmi/dc-srap/issues/78 defining `bibo:accessLink` as a datatype property.

------

### BIBO funder, fundingSource, Funding
- https://github.com/dcmi/dc-srap/issues/77

__PROPOSAL:__

- `bibo:funder` (property): "A person or organization that supports an activity, project or entity through a financial or material contribution.
  - Range: `dcterms:Agent`.

- `bibo:fundingSource` (property): "A source of funding that has supported the activities related to the resource."
  - Range: `bibo:Funding`.

- `bibo:Funding` (class): "An instance of financial or material support provided by a person or organization to enable or sustain an activity, project, or entity."

[Status as of Nov 11](https://github.com/dcmi/dc-srap/issues/77#issuecomment-3476153375): Seven votes in favor.

Tom: Are we decided that these are ObjectProperties?

Karen: I'm not sure. Do we want these ranges? I think these can be strings too.

Tom: We have that problem in DC terms too, that properties are sometimes strings. We cannot do that if we follow the BIBO-style, which takes a stand that these are explicitly referring to resources or literals.

Karen: I tried to look up things in FOAF, but that URL isn't responding right now...

Tom: We seem to have a problem in philosophy.

Osma: I don't see the problem, since we've defined these clearly?

Karen: If someone wants to use a string value, that would be the problem.

Osma: Do we want BIBO to change this approach? I don't think we can.

Karen: No, true, but is this suitable for SRAP?

Tom: In practise, [...] the messiness of the web.

Phil: You can use a bnode and use the string in its name property.

Niklas: [... re. difference between an open vocabulary vs. a precise , the Robustness Principle ; accept in the design or error-correct when data doesn't follow the design?]

Tom: We could document that and accept this precise design?

Karen: Do we need domains on these? Does BIBO have domains for all properties?

Karen: In the SRAP TAP, the values are mostly going to be bnodes.

Tom: I think the resolution looks good; define these as ObjectProperty and use these ranges (and open domain).
... We should follow the style of BIBO for the sake of consistency. If we leave things unspecified, it doesn't actually break anything.

Phil: It seems reasonable not to give fundingSource a domain, since it can be used on more than a particular resource.

Osma: We can use `bibo:funder rdfs:range rdfs:Resource`, to allow funder to be an ObjectProperty with any kind of resource.

Phil: This seems to go in another direction than in the previous issue (of accessLink).

Tom: Are we accepting these to be ObjectProperty?

ALL: Yes.

__RESOLVED__

- `bibo:funder` (ObjectProperty): "A person or organization that supports an activity, project or entity through a financial or material contribution.
  - Range: `dcterms:Agent`.

- `bibo:fundingSource` (ObjectProperty): "A source of funding that has supported the activities related to the resource."
  - Range: `bibo:Funding`.

- `bibo:Funding` (Class): "An instance of financial or material support provided by a person or organization to enable or sustain an activity, project, or entity."

---

__PROPOSAL:__

Dropping proposal for `bibo:Grant` as redundant with `bibo:Funding` (above).

[Grant class #72 - Status as of Nov 11](https://github.com/dcmi/dc-srap/issues/72#issuecomment-3476175286): Seven votes in favor.

__RESOLVED:__ no further discussion; so resolved by default.

------

### `dcterms:accessibilityNote`
- https://github.com/dcmi/dc-srap/issues/79

__FAILED STRAWMAN VOTE:__

`dcterms:accessibilityNote`: "technical capabilities of the resource for users with disabilities or similar needs".

__NEW PROPOSAL FOR STRAWMAN VOTE:__

dcterms:accessibilityNote: "A statement of technical features or deficiencies of the resource that assist or impede universal access."

[Status as of Nov 11](https://github.com/dcmi/dc-srap/issues/79#issuecomment-3516960800). One vote in favor.

Tom: I've made a new consolidated proposal.

Niklas: If the property can also be used to link to features/hazards, I wonder if we're approaching some super-property for the various nuanced properties in schema.org describing accessibility.

Osma: I think we purpose was to explicitly have a DatatypeProperty to provide language describing the accessibility, and leave the structured variants for future work.

Phil: The work came from previous work ("access for all"). These had very sophisticated properties to describe A11Y. That became an ISO standard, and was put forward to other initiatives (LRMI did not take it up). The Schema.org work picked it up. One property was used. We seem to need only this note (similar to accessibilitySummary). We can add a usage note in the definition and say that the detailed properties can be used alongside of this.
... It would be nice to link to an accessibility statement or documentation via a link but perhaps in a different property?

Tom: Agreed.

Osma: In the Finnish accessibility approach, there are two fields, one with a note, and one for more structured definitions.

Tom: We should leave this one open for voting.

Osma: I will discuss with one colleague who has worked on these matters.

__ACTION__: Osma to consult colleague who works on accessibility matters and potentially propose, in addition to `dcterms:accessibilityNote` (already on the table), a second property for capturing aspects of accessibility in a more structured manner.

## Agent-related properties and classes

For discussion on 11 November:
- https://github.com/dcmi/dc-srap/issues/88

__PROPOSAL FOR STRAWMAN VOTE:__

That SRAP use:
- foaf:Organization
- foaf:Person
- bibo:name
  - subproperty of dcterms:title ("name of a resource")
  - range dcterms:Agent
  - definition: "name of an agent resource"
- bibo:affiliation
  - domain "Person" (or "AffiliatedAgent"?)
  - range "Organization"
  - definition: "an organization with which a person has been affiliated"
  - comment: "this is not the person itself but their representation within a particular (bibliographic or similar) context"

Tom: Are we close to a final decision?

Karen: People mostly use dcterms:title as the title of a document.

Tom: I suggested bibo:name to say that it is a specialization of foaf:name, being also dcterms:title.

Osma: I don't see the need for that; we can use foaf:name.

Osma: Regarding affiliation, is there a way to design this clearly to capture that it is not the agent in general, but in this specific context?

Niklas: Well, there is RDF 1.2 annotations as a _future_ way of keeping the use of direct links to "simple/real" resources, while adding  ("in the margins").

Niklas: The difficulty may lie in catering for the consumers (where disambiguation is harder, and distinct resources with general information can be merged without conflation, such as merging the agent description with more data from e.g. ISNI), or producers (who might only have the name and affiliation as strings).

Osma: The AffiliatedAgent model provides the name of the agent and the affiliation, as it appears on the paper.

Niklas: That may be similar to how BIBFRAME models contribution ([bf:Contribution](https://id.loc.gov/ontologies/bibframe.html#c_Contribution), having an agent and other properties).

Osma: Yes.
