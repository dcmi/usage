# Review Process for SRAP

## Voting process
- Discussion happens in issues in the [SRAP repo issue tracker](https://github.com/dcmi/dc-srap/issues) as listed in the [SRAP review project board](https://github.com/orgs/dcmi/projects/4/views/1).
- UB Chairs identify suitable points in the discussion at which to put proposed solutions to a vote.
  - Vote is called with an issue comment marked in one of two ways:
    - `PROPOSED FOR STRAWMAN VOTE:`
    - `PROPOSED FOR FINAL VOTE:`
  - Voting is done by "thumbs up"/"thumbs down".
- Decisions voted on in a call are not finalized until the next review call in order to give all review members -- including members not in attendance on the call -- a chance to vote.
  - Given that proposals are discussed in the issue tracker of the DCMI SRAP Working Group, members of that group will have the opportunity to object to proposed changes. 
  - The absence of objections by WG members will be taken as assent.
- UB Chairs declare when a final decision has been taken by changing `PROPOSED FOR FINAL VOTE:` to read: `DECISION:`.

## Recording and implementation of decisions
- Decisions are recorded by editing an [official record of decisions](https://github.com/dcmi/usage/blob/master/reviews/srap/decisions.md)
- Decisions are implemented by editing the [SRAP specification document](https://dcmi.github.io/dc-srap/srap-profile)
