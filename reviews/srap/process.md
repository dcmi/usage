# Review Process for SRAP

## Voting Process
- Discussion happens in the GitHub issues
- UB Chairs identify suitable points in the discussion at which to put proposed solutions to a vote via a formalized comment containing a call to vote
- there are intermediate ("strawman") votes and final votes (need to be marked as that, respectively)
- voting is done by "thumbs up"/"thumbs down"
- recommendation: deadline is set to next review meeting
- UB Chairs declare when a final decision has been taken
- UB Chairs document the final decision

## Handling Changes to the Proposed Profile

- for changes that where agreed upon by final vote in the DCMI UB review process and agreed upon by the SRAP WG
- for isolated changes with no bigger design ramifications: WG members create PR for the change
- preferred: all (or most) changes in bulk after the DCMI UB review process has been completed

## Documentation Guidelines from the Point of View of DCMI UB

- Does the documentation make sufficiently clear *why* SRAP is needed in the first place?
- Is the documentation clearly written, well structured, easy to read (for humans)? adapted to the target group?
- Does the documentation contain enough and clear enough examples for:
  - the elements of SRAP itself?
  - use cases?
  - systems that are supposed to use SRAP? technical instructions for that?
- Are the design decisions documented in a transparent way, and do they actually serve the *why* of SRAP?
- Summing up: does the documentation serve its purpose, is it comprehensive enough, and is it ready for official publication?
