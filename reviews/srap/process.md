# Review process for SRAP

This document: https://github.com/dcmi/usage/blob/master/reviews/srap/decisions.md

## Sources for this process
- [DCMI-endorsed application profiles: review and approval processes](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/process/) (2021)
- [Legacy Usage Board process](https://www.dublincore.org/legacy/usage-board-process/) (2006)

## Voting
- Discussion happens in issues in the [SRAP repo issue tracker](https://github.com/dcmi/dc-srap/issues) as listed in the [SRAP review project board](https://github.com/orgs/dcmi/projects/4/views/1) and in [Zoom calls](https://github.com/dcmi/usage/tree/master/reviews/srap/minutes).
- UB Chairs identify suitable points in the discussion at which to put proposed solutions to a vote. When a vote is called, the proposed resolution is marked appropriately (eg, as `PROPOSED FOR STRAWMAN VOTE:` or `PROPOSED FOR FINAL VOTE:` and a link to that issue posting is added to the agenda for the next Zoom call. Voting is done on the issue posting using "thumbs up"/"thumbs down".
- Decisions voted on in a call are not finalized until the next review call in order to give all review members – including members not in attendance on the call – a chance to vote.
- From the [Usage Board process of 2006](https://www.dublincore.org/legacy/usage-board-process/): "To be approved, a proposal needs more than 50% of assigned votes in favor and less than 25% of assigned votes against." In practice, the UB chairs aim for a solid consensus among voting members.
- When a proposed resolution is approved, UB Chairs mark the issue text as `RESOLVED`.

## Recording and implementation of decisions
- Decisions are recorded in an [official record of decisions](https://github.com/dcmi/usage/blob/master/reviews/srap/decisions.md).
- Decisions are implemented:
  - When the UB Chairs make the agreed changes in namespace documents for DCMI Metadata Terms or BIBO.
  - When the SRAP editor makes the agreed changes in the [SRAP specification document](https://dcmi.github.io/dc-srap/srap-profile).
