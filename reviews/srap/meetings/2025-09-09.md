## Agenda

- Introduction of chairs and call participants (Tom)
- Introduction to [SRAP](https://dcmi.github.io/dc-srap/srap-profile) (Osma)
  - [SRAP proposal for the UB](https://github.com/dcmi/dc-srap/blob/main/srap-proposal.md)
  -	[SRAP repository with all materials](https://github.com/dcmi/dc-srap)

- Organizational details of review process (Argie):
  - [SRAP review project board](https://github.com/orgs/dcmi/projects/4/views/1?layout_template=board)
  - How many meetings, when, and how long (60-90 minutes)? Preferences of reviewers? Change times and days of the week around, for fairness?

- Discussion of review process:
  - Guidelines regarding general points (Argie):
    - Does the documentation make sufficiently clear *why* SRAP is needed in the first place?
    - Is the documentation clearly written, well structured, easy to read (for humans)? adapted to the target group?
    - Does the documentation contain enough and clear enough examples for:
      - the elements of SRAP itself?
      - use cases?
      - systems that are supposed to use SRAP? technical instructions for that?
    - Are the design decisions documented in a transparent way, and do they actually serve the *why* of SRAP?
    - Summing up: does the documentation serve its purpose, is it comprehensive enough, and is it ready for official publication?
  - About in-depth questions (Niklas):
    - Question to SRAP WG: will there possibly be future versions? Or is this expected to be fairly static?
    - Terms to add to BIBO
    - How does SRAP refer to DC-TAP, and do we as UB agree with that? 
    - One of the most discussion-worthy issues seemed to be how to model roles.
    - Anything else?
