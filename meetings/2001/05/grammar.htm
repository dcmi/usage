      <H3>Dublin Core Made Simple</H3>
      <P><B>Dublin Core as a Language.</B> Dublin Core is often presented as a 
      modern form of <I>catalog card</I> -- a <I>set</I> of elements (and now 
      qualifiers) that describe resources in a complete <I>package</I>. 
      Sometimes it is proposed as an <I>exchange format</I> for sharing records 
      among multiple collections. The founding principle that "every element is 
      optional and repeatable" reinforces the notion that a <I>Dublin Core 
      description</I> is to be taken as a whole. This paper, in contrast, is 
      based on a much different premise: Dublin Core is a 
      <B><I>language</I></B>. More precisely, it is a small language for making 
      a particular <B><I>class of statements</I></B> about resources. Like 
      natural languages, it has a vocabulary of word-like terms, the two classes 
      of which -- elements and qualifiers -- function within statements like 
      nouns and adjectives [<A 
      href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/october00/baker/10baker.html#note1">1</A>]; 
      and it has a syntax for arranging elements and qualifiers into statements 
      according to a simple pattern [<A 
      href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/october00/baker/10baker.html#note2">2</A>]. 
      </P>
      <P><B>A Pidgin for Digital Tourists.</B> Whenever tourists order a meal or 
      ask directions in an unfamiliar language, considerate native speakers will 
      spontaneously limit themselves to basic words and simple sentence patterns 
      along the lines of "<B><I>I am</I></B> so-and-so" or "<B><I>This 
      is</I></B> such-and-such". Linguists call this pidginization. In such 
      situations, a small phrase book or translated menu can be most helpful. By 
      analogy, today's Web has been called an Internet Commons where users and 
      information providers from a wide range of scientific, commercial, and 
      social domains present their information in a variety of incompatible data 
      models and description languages. In this context, Dublin Core presents 
      itself as a metadata pidgin for digital tourists who must find their way 
      in this linguistically diverse landscape. Its vocabulary is small enough 
      to learn quickly, and its basic pattern is easily grasped. It is 
      well-suited to serve as an auxiliary language for digital libraries.</P>
      <P><B>This Grammar.</B> This grammar starts by defining terms. It then 
      follows a 200-year-old tradition of English grammar teaching by focusing 
      on the structure of single statements (see the Reed and Kellogg quote 
      above). It concludes by looking at the growing dictionary of Dublin Core 
      vocabulary terms -- its <I>registry</I>, and at how statements can be used 
      to build the metadata equivalent of paragraphs and compositions -- the 
      <I>application profile</I>.</P>
      <H3>Elements and Qualifiers</H3>
      <P><B>Vocabulary terms in general.</B> Strictly speaking, a Dublin Core 
      element or qualifier is a unique identifier formed by a name (e.g., title) 
      prefixed by the URI of the namespace in which it is defined, as in 
      http://dublincore.org/2000/03/13-dces#title. In this context, a namespace 
      is a vocabulary that has been formally published, usually on the Web; it 
      describes elements and qualifiers with natural-language labels, 
      definitions, and other relevant documentation. Currently there are two 
      namespaces for Dublin Core: the Dublin Core element set and the Dublin 
      Core Qualifiers, denoted here by the conventional abbreviations dc: and 
      dcq: [<A 
      href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/october00/baker/10baker.html#dcmi1999">DCMI 
      1999</A>, <A 
      href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/october00/baker/10baker.html#dcmi2000">DCMI 
      2000</A>]. In this paper, as in many application environments, the 
      elements and qualifiers are referred to in a machine-readable short form, 
      such as dc:title.</P>
      <P><B>Elements.</B> The fifteen elements of the Dublin Core element set 
      are the defining feature of Dublin Core as a language. In their short 
      form, the elements are dc:title, dc:creator, dc:subject, dc:description, 
      dc:publisher, dc:contributor, dc:date, dc:type, dc:format, dc:identifier, 
      dc:source, dc:language, dc:relation, dc:coverage, and dc:rights. These 
      correspond to fifteen broadly defined <I>properties</I> of resources that 
      are generally useful for searching across repositories in multiple 
      domains.</P>
      <P><B>Qualifiers.</B> Qualifiers modify the properties of Dublin Core 
      statements by specifying, in the manner of natural-language adjectives, 
      "what kind" of subject, date, or relation. Qualifiers currently fall into 
      two classes. <I>Encoding schemes</I> are pointers to contextual 
      information or parsing rules that aid in the interpretation of an element 
      value. For example, dcq:lcsh qualifies dc:subject to specify that the 
      keywords are a Library of Congress Subject Heading, and dcq:iso8601 
      qualifies dc:date to specify that the string "2000-06-13" is formatted 
      according to an international standard. <I>Element refinements</I> make a 
      property more specific without extending its meaning, such as dcq:revised 
      as a modifier of dc:date (yielding "date revised"). In July 2000, a DCMI 
      Usage Committee recommended a batch of fifty-two qualifiers to exemplify 
      these principles of qualification, but the qualifiers for Dublin Core 
      statements may also come from other namespaces, as in the example 
      yans:author below (where yans: is a hypothetical YetAnotherNameSpace).</P>
      <P><B>Elements and qualifiers defined in languages other than English.</B> 
      Strictly speaking, elements and qualifiers are represented by 
      machine-readable tokens that stand for general concepts such as "title," 
      "subject," and "date." The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative discusses and 
      approves their definitions in English. In principle, however, they can be 
      labelled and defined equally well in any other language, such as Dutch or 
      Arabic or Thai. For example, dc:creator may be labeled "Creatore" in 
      Italian, "Pencipta" in Bahasa Indonesian, or "Verfasser" in German [<A 
      href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/october00/baker/10baker.html#baker">Baker 
      1998</A>]. To date, the element set has been translated into twenty-six 
      languages. Bear in mind as you read that although this grammar is written 
      in English, a Japanese version could translate every English word here 
      into Japanese -- all grammar terms and example sentences included -- 
      <I>except</I> for the English-like names of the tokens themselves.</P>
      <H3>Dublin Core Statements</H3>
      <P><B>Diagramming statements.</B> Since the 1870s, the grammar of 
      sentences has been taught in (American) high schools using sentence 
      diagrams [<A 
      href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/october00/baker/10baker.html#reed">Reed and 
      Kellogg 1886</A>, <A 
      href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/october00/baker/10baker.html#house">House 
      and Harman 1950</A>, <A 
      href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/october00/baker/10baker.html#warriner">Warriner 
      et al. 1973</A>]. This style has a binary flavor -- the sentence baseline 
      is intersected to divide the <I>subject</I>, "that of which something is 
      said," from the <I>predicate</I>, that which is said of the subject. 
      Within the predicate, a smaller line separates the <I>object</I> (in 
      Dublin Core terms, the property) from the <I>objective complement</I> (in 
      Dublin Core, the property value). This style is nicely expressive of 
      Dublin Core because the qualifiers, hanging below the baseline on slanted 
      lines, are visibly subordinate to the properties they modify (see Figures 
      1 and 2).</P>
      <P align=center><IMG src="A Grammar of Dublin Core_files/dc_fig1.gif"></P>
      <P align=center><A name=dc_fig1.gif></A><B>Figure 1: The general 
      pattern</B></P>
      <P><B>Parts of a Statement.</B> Dublin Core is in effect a class of 
      statements of the pattern "Resource has property X," where "resource" is 
      the implied subject; followed by an implied verb ("has"); followed by one 
      of fifteen properties from the Dublin Core element set; followed by a 
      property value -- an appropriate literal such as a person's name, a date, 
      some words, or a URL. For example: "Resource has dc:creator 'Tom Baker'," 
      and "Resource has dc:date '2000-06-13'." Optional qualifiers may make the 
      meaning of a property more definite, as in "Resource has dc:date 
      dcq:revised '2000-06-13'."</P>
      <P><B>Principles of Qualification.</B> The qualification of Dublin Core 
      properties is guided by a rule known colloquially as the Dumb-Down 
      Principle. According to this rule, "a client should be able to ignore any 
      qualifier and use the description as if it were unqualified. While this 
      may result in some loss of specificity, the remaining element value (minus 
      the qualifier) must continue to be generally correct and useful for 
      discovery" [<A 
      href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/october00/baker/10baker.html#dcmi2000">DCMI 
      2000</A>]. Qualification is therefore supposed only to refine, not extend 
      the semantic scope of a property. In borderline cases, qualification 
      should not result in a literal that could be misleading.</P>
      <P><B>Appropriate Literals.</B> Whether a property value is "useful for 
      discovery" is at the heart of the notion of appropriateness. A property 
      value should be a string of an expected type -- usually, for example, some 
      sort of name for dc:creator, dc:contributor, dc:publisher, or dc:title; a 
      URL for dc:relation, dc:identifier, or dc:source; full-text sentences for 
      dc:description; short text strings or keywords for dc:subject, dc:type, 
      dc:format, and dc:language; and a recognizable combination of years, 
      months, and days for dc:date. Both in theory and in practice, the range of 
      expected data types varies from property to property; which types are 
      appropriate for a given property is open to interpretation and debate (see 
      below).</P>
      <P><B>Evaluating Statements.</B> To test whether a Dublin Core statement 
      is conceptually solid, cover the qualifiers with your hand ("dumbing 
      down"), read the statement above the line, and ask:</P>
      <UL>
        <LI>Does it make sense? 
        <LI>Is it factually and logically correct? 
        <LI>Is the literal "appropriate" for the given property?</LI></UL>

      <P align=center><A name=dc_fig3.gif></A><B>Figure 2: Some statements, 
      diagrammed</B></P>Resource has dc:title 'A Grammar of Dublin Core.' 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>Does it make sense? Yes. Is it correct? Yes. Is the literal 
        "appropriate"? Yes, a sequence of words is normal and expected for the 
        property dc:title. </BLOCKQUOTE>Resource has dcq:iso8601 dcq:revised 
      dc:date '2000-06-13.' 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>This means that a resource was revised on 6 June 2000. The 
        statement dumbs down to "Resource has dc:date '2000-06-13'," which means 
        that the date 6 June 2000 has something to do with the life-cycle of the 
        resource. This is less specific than the qualified statement, but still 
        correct. </BLOCKQUOTE>Resource has dcq:lcsh dc:subject 'Languages -- 
      Grammar.' 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>This says that the resource is about the subject "grammar of 
        languages," and that these words are a controlled term from the Library 
        of Congress Subject Headings. The statement dumbs down to "Resource has 
        dc:subject 'Languages -- Grammar'," which makes sense even if we do not 
        know that the term comes from the Library of Congress. 
      </BLOCKQUOTE>Resource has yans:cerif dc:subject 'H352 Grammar, semantics, 
      semiotics, syntax.' 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>This literal includes a language-independent abbreviation, 
        "H352," which will be useful for applications that understand 
        yans:cerif. The string "H352" may confuse some users, but otherwise does 
        no harm. </BLOCKQUOTE>Resource has yans:author dc:creator 'Tom Baker.' 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>Users of the yans: namespace will recognize that yans:author 
        is being used here as an adjective modifying dc:creator (just as 
        <I>talk</I> is an adjective modifying <I>show</I> in the phrase <I>talk 
        show</I>). It is an awkward but correct way to say that Tom Baker is 
        "the author sort of creator" -- i.e., the author -- of the resource. 
        This statement dumbs down to "Resource has dc:creator 'Tom Baker'," -- 
        less specific but still correct. </BLOCKQUOTE>Resource has dc:relation 
      'http://www.dlib.org/dlib/december98/12baker.html.' 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>The statement asserts that the resource is somehow related 
        to an article in <EM>D-Lib Magazine</EM> (a URL is appropriate as a 
        literal for dc:relation). </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <H3>Some not-so-good examples</H3>Resource has dc:creator 
      'name.given:Thomas; name.family:Baker; employer:GMD; contact:Schloss 
      Birlinghoven, D-53754 Sankt Augustin.' 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>A reader can see what this <I>compound</I> or <I>structured 
        value</I> is saying. But a search engine would need to know how to parse 
        out the components and suppress the tags in order to index this cleanly, 
        lest a search for creators named "Augustin" should yield false hits. 
        Generally speaking, things like affiliations and addresses -- properties 
        <I>of the creator</I> of a resource -- do not belong in Dublin Core 
        statements about the resource itself. Metadata providers that used such 
        compound values within specific usage communities could "speak Dublin 
        Core" to the rest of the world by exporting just the name ("Resource has 
        dc:creator 'Thomas Baker'"). </BLOCKQUOTE>Resource has yans:creator 'Tom 
      Baker.' 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>This statement is useful for applications that recognize the 
        yans: namespace, but it is not a "Dublin Core" statement per se. If the 
        yans: and dc: definitions of Creator were compatible, either the 
        metadata provider or an indexing application could use a crosswalk to 
        translate this into the Dublin Core statement "Resource has dc:creator 
        'Tom Baker'." </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <H3>Ongoing Issues</H3>
      <P><B>Fifteen fuzzy buckets.</B> The properties of Dublin Core are like 
      fifteen big buckets, and the rules about which types of literals may be 
      placed in those buckets are somewhat fuzzy. This fuzziness is intentional 
      -- the Internet is a diverse and chaotic place where a more disciplined, 
      top-down approach to standardization is unrealistic, especially for use 
      across multiple domains and languages. If the rules of Dublin Core were 
      more precise, people would inevitably bend them. In the jargon of computer 
      science, then, Dublin Core is "weakly typed" as a language. A search 
      engine may find a variety of information types in any given bucket -- from 
      URLs to non-textual, alphanumeric strings to full text in any 
language.</P>
      <P><B>The "appropriateness" of literals.</B> Requirements for the 
      appropriateness of a literal are in practice somewhat contradictory. 
      Ideally, a literal should be useful for discovery, which means it should 
      make sense "as is" to the average user. Yet it should also be processable 
      in an expected way by search engines. Programmers need to be know, for 
      example, when to index on strings separated by white space, minus 
      punctuation and stop words, when to expect a URL, and when to expect an 
      alphanumeric date string. Some elements are particularly ambiguous in this 
      regard. Dc:rights, for example, can be free text or a URL. Dc:coverage can 
      be a place name, the name of a time period, a numeric identifier for a 
      place or time, or even a compound value -- in effect, a miniature schema 
      with multiple sub-components separated by semicolons or XML tags. Where 
      such a range of data types is permissible, should it be acceptable to 
      relax the Dumb-Down Principle? Should qualifiers in effect modify the 
      expected data type of the literal? Or should the presence of, say, XML 
      angle brackets be expected to trigger, automatically, a change in parsing 
      algorithms? Would such a complexification of a property compensate for the 
      corresponding loss of Dublin Core's overall simplicity? Or can the need 
      for complex description be resolved in a broader framework, outside Dublin 
      Core per se?</P>
      <P><B>Application profiles.</B> One broader framework for such a 
      resolution is the <I>application profile</I>. As currently defined, 
      application profiles are the metadata equivalent of regional idioms or 
      creoles (complexified pidgins). Implementors who need an application 
      language more expressive than a pidgin may combine elements and qualifiers 
      from Dublin Core with elements from other namespaces into a richer 
      vocabulary or embed them into a syntactically more sophisticated data 
      model. Such linguistic innovation is considered by many people to be 
      reasonable as long as implementors respect a distinction between 
      namespaces, where elements and qualifiers are given standard definitions, 
      and profiles, where elements from multiple namespaces are (only) reused, 
      combined, adapted, and constrained [<A 
      href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/october00/baker/10baker.html#heery">Heery 
      2000</A>]. The profile, then, is the natural locus for full descriptions 
      -- the catalog card or metadata package taken as a whole.</P>
      <P><B>For example,</B> the Collection Description Schema of the Research 
      Support Libraries Programme (RSLP) in the UK uses dc:title -- officially 
      defined as a "name given to the resource" -- but defines it more narrowly 
      as a "name given <I>to the collection</I>." Alongside such Dublin Core 
      elements, it uses elements from other namespaces, such as 
      cld:accessConditions (for the hours of access and classes of permitted 
      users) from a local "Collection Level Description" namespace. These 
      elements are framed in a data model that specifies typical relationships 
      between a collection, its individual items, a collector, an owner, a 
      location, and the constituent parts of a collection -- each of which may 
      be described with multiple attributes [<A 
      href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/october00/baker/10baker.html#rslp">RSLP</A>]. 
      An RSLP description does not talk just about information resources per se, 
      but also about the people, organizations, and access frameworks related to 
      those resources.</P>
      <P><B>Developing profiles and coining new elements.</B> Some working 
      groups of DCMI are developing domain-specific profiles of Dublin Core, 
      surveying the descriptive needs of domains such as education and 
      government to determine an appropriate mix of Dublin Core elements and 
      elements from other namespaces and perhaps to coin additional elements for 
      concepts not covered in existing standards. These working groups need to 
      consider that literals appropriate to domain specialists may not make much 
      sense to general users, especially in statements that have been "dumbed 
      down." As the example above makes clear, moreover, core elements are 
      needed for classes of resources other than document-like objects, such as

      conventions for combining multiple entities within an application profile

      <P><B>Building a dictionary (registry) for Dublin Core.</B> Historically,

      Metadata languages like Dublin Core have hitherto been developed 
      prescriptively, in standards committees, as there have been no convenient 
      ways to track local innovations in usage and feed them back into the 
      standardization process. However, several related developments are now 
      enabling the collective construction of metadata dictionaries, or 
      registries. The new Resource Description Framework (RDF) Schemas standard 
      of the World Wide Web Consortium provides a format for publishing schemas 
      that can be harvested by metadata search engines [<A 
      href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/october00/baker/10baker.html#w3c2000">W3C 
      2000</A>]. Eric Miller has developed an open-source software toolkit for 
      indexing a distributed corpus of RDF schemas as one huge database, with an 
      interface for following hyperlinked cross-references between related terms 
      in namespaces and profiles -- in effect, a metadata schema browser [<A 
      href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/october00/baker/10baker.html#eor">EOR</A>]. 
      The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is using this toolkit to manage its 
      namespace [<A 
      href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/october00/baker/10baker.html#open">Open 
      Metadata Registry</A>], and a working group is formulating technical and 
      policy guidelines for its ongoing management [<A

      A European project, SCHEMAS, is promoting the use of RDF schemas to help 
      harmonize metadata practice among EU-funded projects and is using RDF to 
      build a layer of annotated pointers to namespaces, profiles, and metadata 
      activities generally [<A

      <P><B>Does your application speak Dublin Core?</B> Pidgins are inherently 
      limited in what they can express, but they are easy to learn and 
      enormously useful. In real life, we talk one way to our professional 
      colleagues and another way to visitors from other cultures. Our digital 
      library applications need to do this as well. Simplicity and complexity 
      are both appropriate, depending on context. If Dublin Core is too simple 
      or generic to use as the native idiom of a particular application, pidgin 
      statements may be extracted or translated from richer idioms that exist 
      for specialized domains. This output should also be filtered to keep the 
      fifteen buckets clear of encoding debris and semantic silt. One should 
      treat digital tourists with courtesy and hide from them the complexities 
      of a local application vocabulary or grammar. However sophisticated its 
      local idiom may be, an application might also speak a pidgin that general 
      users and generic search engines will understand. Simple, semantically 
      clean, computationally obvious values will help us negotiate our way 
      through a splendidly diverse and heterogeneous Internet.</P>

      <H3>Appendix: Dublin Core and RDF grammar compared</H3>
      <P class=smallfont><B>Directed Labelled Graphs.</B> The Resource 
      Description Framework (RDF), a relatively new standard of the World Wide 
      Web Consortium, is emerging as an information model and encoding format of 
      choice for metadata and application profiles that use Dublin Core [<A 
      href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/october00/baker/10baker.html#w3c1999">W3C 
      1999</A>, <A 
      href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/october00/baker/10baker.html#w3c2000">W3C 
      2000</A>]. RDF is a grammar for expressing relationships among resources 
      located or represented somewhere on the Internet. These relationships are 
      depicted graphically with Directed Labelled Graphs (DLGs), which use arcs 
      (predicates expressing properties) to establish a relationship between 
      multiple nodes (resources). Nodes are seen as subjects or objects 
      depending on the direction of the arrow.</P>

      general pattern of RDF statements ("triples")</B></P>
      <P class=smallfont><B>RDF triples.</B> In contrast to the binary flavor of 
      the pedagogical English grammars cited above, the model of RDF statements 
      is a tripartite one of <I>subject</I>, <I>predicate</I>, and <I>object</I> 
      (see Figure 3). RDF statements, accordingly, are called "triples":</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE class=smallfont>A <I>property</I> is a specific aspect, 
        characteristic, attribute, or relation used to describe a resource. ... 
        A specific resource together with the named property plus the value of 
        that property for that resource is an RDF <I>statement</I>. These three 
        individual parts of a statement are called, respectively, the 
        <I>subject</I>, the <I>predicate</I>, and the <I>object</I>. The object 
        of a statement (i.e., the property value) can be another resource or it 
        can be a literal; i.e., a resource (specified by a URI) or a simple 
        string or other primitive datatype defined by XML. In RDF terms, a 
        <I>literal</I> may have content that is XML markup but is not further 
        evaluated by the RDF processor [<A 
        href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/october00/baker/10baker.html#w3c1999">W3C

      <P class=smallfont>Figure 4 shows an RDF triple consisting of the subject

      <P class=smallfont><B>Subject of an RDF statement.</B> The subject of an 
      RDF statement is anything that can be named by a Universal Resource 
      Identifier (URI). In principle, this is anything from a Web page or museum 
      artifact to an abstract concept or event. The subject of a Dublin Core 
      statement, in contrast, is an anonymous "information resource," perhaps a 
      "document-like object" [<A 
      href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/october00/baker/10baker.html#note3">3</A>]. 
      In Dublin Core, the subject ("resource") is always implied, never named as 
      in RDF. The RDF statement in Figure 4, then, would be expressed in Dublin 
      Core as two statements: "Resource has dc:identifier 
      'http://www.w3.org/Home/Lassila'," and "Resource has dc:creator 'Ora 
      Lassila'." As long as it is clear from the context that the two statements 
      refer to the same resource -- for instance, they are both in the same 
      record -- one can infer that Ora Lassila has created the Web page [<A 
      href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/october00/baker/10baker.html#note4">4</A>].

      <P class=smallfont align=center><B>Figure 5: Grammar Terms 
Compared</B></P>
      <P class=smallfont><B>Predicate of an RDF statement.</B> The predicate of 
      an RDF statement is an implied verb plus a property. This is more 
      restricted than the standard definition of a predicate in high-school 
      English grammar, which includes (in effect) "everything to the right of 
      the vertical intersector in a sentence diagram" -- that is, everything 
      within a clause that is said about a subject. However, since most people 
      have only the vaguest recollection of predicates from high school, this 
      grammar avoids using the term at all.</P>
      <P class=smallfont><B>Property value of RDF statements.</B> In RDF, these 
      are called <I>objects</I>. But again, there is risk of confusion with 
      English grammar. In the sentence "This paper has the title 'A Grammar of 
      Dublin Core'," some high-school English grammars see 'A Grammar of Dublin 
      Core' as an <I>objective complement</I> with respect to the <I>object</I> 
      of the sentence, "title" (see Figure 5). Compounding the confusion, 
      computer scientists are oriented to <I>objects</I> of a much different 
      sort, and the "resource" of a Dublin Core statement might even be a 
      physical <I>object</I>. This grammar avoids the term <I>object</I> 
      altogether.</P>
      <P class=smallfont><B>The lack of qualifiers in RDF.</B> In Dublin Core, 
      qualifiers depend on and modify one of Dublin Core's fifteen elements 
      (properties). The basic RDF model does not express this type of 
      dependency. Properties may relate to another as narrower to broader terms 
      (using the relation "SubPropertyOf"), as "Author" relates to "Creator." In 
      native RDF, however, both "Author" and "Creator" are full properties in 
      their own right.</P>
      <P class=smallfont><B>The compatibility of Dublin Core and RDF.</B> The 
      differences between Dublin Core and RDF outlined above are largely 
      terminological; at issue is what the parts of a statement such as 
      'Resource has Property X' should be called. The difficulty of choosing the 
      right words for this grammar should not obscure the basic compatibility 
      and complementarity of Dublin Core and RDF. RDF offers a general model for 
      statements, while Dublin Core offers a particular type of pidgin-like 
      statement about information resources and privileges a small set of 
      special words. RDF offers a specific encoding in XML for expressing its 
      conceptual model, while Dublin Core is by design independent of any 
      particular encoding format. RDF, then, is just one of the possible 
      information models that can use tokens from Dublin Core, while Dublin Core 
      is just one of the languages expressible in RDF.</P>
      <H3>Footnotes</H3><A name=note1></A>
      <P class=smallfont>[1] It would be desirable to have a word for Dublin 
      Core vocabulary terms in general -- elements and qualifiers as a whole -- 
      just as natural-language nouns, verbs, adjectives, and conjunctions are 
      all called <I>words</I>. Unfortunately, <I>entities</I>, <I>concepts</I>, 
      and <I>symbols</I> are all too abstract and vague; <I>words</I> are 
      associated too closely with natural language; and <I>lexemes</I> are too 
      obscure. The first draft of this paper spoke generically of 
      <I>elements</I> and distinguished between <I>core elements</I> and 
      <I>qualifiers</I>, but veterans of Dublin Core found this confusing. The 
      next draft introduced <I>tokens</I>, which conveys the notion that Dublin 
      Core vocabulary terms stand for general concepts that are defined and 
      labeled in many natural languages, but people also found this confusing. 
      <I>Vocabulary terms</I> seems a bit cumbersome, so I avoid the term 
      whenever possible and speak simply of <I>elements and 
      qualifiers</I>.</P><A name=note2></A>
      <P class=smallfont>[2] Early in the workshop series, before it was 
      formally called a Metadata Initiative, the Dublin Core effort was declared 
      to be primarily about <I>semantics</I> in contrast to <I>syntax</I>, and 
      the latter was declared to be out of scope. In that context, however, 
      <I>syntax</I> referred to the encoding of metadata in HTML, database, and 
      (later) XML or RDF formats; it involved questions such as which tags to 
      place where, within what angle brackets or punctuation, and how to group 
      or nest related elements. This grammar, in contrast, presents the 
      <I>syntax</I> of Dublin Core statements in a linguistic sense, as the 
      rules governing how the words of a sentence are related to each other -- 
      which words modify other words, and which words are of central importance 
      in the statement.</P><A name=note3></A>
      <P class=smallfont>[3] In practice, the reasoning behind this is circular: 
      Dublin Core properties are appropriate for any entity that has such 
      properties. This circularity has spared us a perhaps futile attempt to 
      seek philosophical consensus on a universal ontology of entity classes and 
      allowed us to get on with the task of describing whatever it is we are 
      describing.</P><A name=note4></A>
      <P class=smallfont>[4] Dan Brickley points out that software tools could 
      exploit additional information about entities and vocabularies to 
      translate sequences of RDF-encoded Dublin Core statements into a 
      natural-language style that flows more elegantly and reads less like a 
      pidgin.</P>

      <P class=smallfont><EM>The following four changes and corrections were 
      made at the request of the author, Thomas Baker, on 10/17/00): 1.) In the 
      paragraph "Does your application speak Dublin Core?" one phrase was 
      changed from: "its elements can be embedded in a richer local vocabulary 
      from which pidgin statements can be generated or extracted as needed." to 
      read "pidgin statements may be extracted or translated from richer idioms 
      that exist for specialized domains." 2.) The name Linda Hill was added to 
      the "Acknowledgements" section. 3.) In the paragraph "Vocabulary terms in 
      general", "(e.g., Title)" was changed to "(e.g., title)." 4.) In the 
      commentary of the first of the "Not-so-good examples," the sentence 
      "Resource has dc:creator 'Tom Baker'" was changed to: "Resource has 
      dc:creator 'Thomas Baker'". </EM></P><!-- Standard Copyright line here -->
