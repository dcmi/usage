= Introduction =


This document describes a DC Application Profile for describing an eprint, or scholarly work.  The application profile is based on the SWAP [http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/repositories/digirep/index/Model Model], which is in turn based on FRBR.  The model comprises 5 entities - ScholarlyWork, Expression, Manifestation, Copy and Agent.  This application profile provides a way of describing these entities as part of a ''description set'' (a set of related DC ''descriptions'').

The notion of a ''description set'' is part of the DCMI Abstract Model.  Readers that are not familiar with the DCMI Abstract Model should read [http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/repositories/digirep/index/A_note_about_the_DCMI_Abstract_Model A note about the DCMI Abstract Model] before proceeding.

All the examples in this document are formatted according to the DC-Text notation.  Readers who are not familiar with DC-Text should read [http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/repositories/digirep/index/A_note_about_DC-Text A note about DC-Text] before proceeding.

In the context of this work an eprint is defined to be a ''scientific or scholarly research text'' (as defined by the [http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/boaifaq.htm#literature Budapest Open Access Initiative]), for example a peer-reviewed journal article, a preprint, a working paper, a thesis, a book chapter, a report, etc.

= Scholarly Works Application Profile =

Each ''description set'' that complies with the Scholarly Works Application Profile is made up of a set of related ''descriptions'' about the entities listed above.  Therefore, a typical ''description set'' (using the DC-Text notation) has the following structure:

 `Description Set (`[[BR]]
   `Description (`[[BR]]
     `# description of the eprint as a ScholarlyWork`[[BR]]
     `...`[[BR]]
   `)`[[BR]]
   `Description (`[[BR]]
     `# description of an Expression of the eprint`[[BR]]

     `...`[[BR]]
   `)`[[BR]]
   `Description (`[[BR]]
     `# description of an author, funder, supervisor of the eprint or an affiliated institution`[[BR]]
     `...`[[BR]]
   `)`[[BR]]
   `Description (`[[BR]]
     `# description of an editor of an Expression of the eprint`[[BR]]
     `...`[[BR]]
   `)`[[BR]]
   `Description (`[[BR]]
     `# description of the publisher of a Manifestation of an Expression of the eprint`[[BR]]
     `...`[[BR]]
   `)`[[BR]]
   `...`[[BR]]
 `)`[[BR]]

Each ''description set'' describes only one eprint (i.e. one ScholarlyWork entity).  However, multiple ''descriptions'' may be used to describe multiple Expression, Manifestation and Agent entities as necessary.

The metadata terms that may be used to describe each entity are described below.  Note that all ''properties'' may be repeated if necessary.  Unless otherwise noted, multiple ''value strings'' should be provided using separate ''statements''.  Where appropriate, each ''value string'' may have an associated ''language tag''.

A minimal ''description set'' that conforms to this application profile must include either:

 * a single ScholarlyWork ''description'' with at least one dc:title ''statement'' and one dc:type ''statement'' indicating that this is an entity of type http://purl.org/eprint/entityType/ScholarlyWork, or
 * a single ScholarlyWork ''description'' with one one dc:type ''statement'' indicating that this is an entity of type http://purl.org/eprint/entityType/ScholarlyWork and one eprints:isExpressedAs ''statement'' linking to a single Expression ''description'' with at least one dc:title ''statement'' and one dc:type ''statement'' indicating that this is an entity of type http://purl.org/eprint/entityType/Expression.

All other aspects of the application profile are optional.

Where personal or organisational names are provided as ''value strings'', the following guidelines should be followed.

Personal names should be listed surname or family name first, followed by comma-space, then the "usual" or preferred form of forenames and/or initials followed by a full stop.  If necessary, this may be followed by the full set of spelled-out forenames in round brackets. Use the same form of name for all eprints, irrespective of the form used on the item itself. ||

In the case of organizations where there is clearly a hierarchy present, list the parts of the hierarchy from largest to smallest, separated by full stops. If it is not clear whether there is a hierarchy present, or unclear which is the larger or smaller portion of the body, give the name as it appears in the eprint. ||

[[Anchor(A_note_about_using_identifiers)]]
= A note about using identifiers =

Each of the entities in the model may be assigned a URI, encoded as the ''resource URI'' in the description of that entity.

It should be noted, however, that assigning and encoding a URI is not mandatory for any of the entities.  Although the lack of a URI for any entity means that the entity can not be referenced from within metadata records in other eprint systems, the assignment of URIs to entities should be performed with care (and, where possible, after first checking whether a URI has already been assigned to the entity elsewhere).  Multiple URIs for a single entity are likely to cause problems for downstream eprint systems, since it may be difficult for them to determine algorithmically whether any two URIs identify the same entity.

Where the ScholarlyWork and Expression entities in a ''description set'' have additional URIs, these should be encoded in one or more dc:identifier ''statements''.  As noted in the relevant sections above, in cases where there are multiple URIs for any entity, one of the URIs should be used as the ''resource URI''.  Recommended best practice is to use a DOI or Handle as the ''resource URI'', where these exist.

The URIs assigned to each of the entities should uniquely identify a single entity.  There may be more than one URI per entity, but each URI should only identify one entity.

It is an implementation issue whether the URIs assigned to the ScholarlyWork and Expression entities dereference to a representation of that entity.  However, it is anticipated that eprint systems are likely to be configured such that the URI for ScholarlyWork and/or Expression entities dereference to a 'jump-off page' for the eprint, as served by the archive.

In all cases where a dc:identifier ''statement'' is provided, use a ''syntax encoding scheme URI'' to indicate that a URI is being provided. ||

'''For example:'''

 `Statement (`[[BR]]
   `Property URI ( dc:identifier )`[[BR]]
   `Value String ( "http://eprints.bath.ac.uk/archive/00000003/"`[[BR]]
     `Syntax Encoding Scheme URI ( dcterms:URI )`[[BR]]
   `)`[[BR]]
 `)`[[BR]]

It is not yet clear whether current practice is to assign DOIs at the level of the Work or at the level of the Expression (as those terms are used in FRBR) or in a more fine-grained way.  The current [http://www.crossref.org/01company/15doi_info.html Crossref  documentation] indicates that DOIs should be assigned to the 'work', however it is not clear that this usage of the word 'work' corresponds with its usage in FRBR - in fact, it is rather more likely that it corresponds with the use of the term Expression in FRBR.

There is also other evidence that publishers typically assign DOIs at the level of the FRBR Expression.  For example, the [http://www.doi.org/handbook_2000/intro.html#1.6.4 DOI Handbook discussion about 'granularity'] concludes that in practice it is safer to assign separate DOIs to each language translation of a given article, i.e. to assign DOIs at the level of the Expression.

As a result, it is suggested that the following guidelines are followed when making use of DOIs in the context of this application profile:

 * If the DOI has been assigned to all possible expressions and manifestations of the eprint (e.g. it is intended to resolve to both the HTML format of the preprint and the PDF format of the formally published article), use the DOI as the ''resource URI'' for the ScholarlyWork entity (and also encode it as the ''value string'' of a dc:identifier ''statement'' for that entity).
 * If the DOI has been assigned to all manifestations of a particular expression of the eprint (e.g. it is intended to resolve to all the formats of the Spanish language version of the formally published article), use the DOI as the ''resource URI'' for the Expression entity.
 * If the DOI has been assigned to a particular manifestation of an expression of the eprint (e.g. it is intended to resolve only to the PDF format of the French-language translation of the formally published article), use the DOI as the ''resource URI'' for the Manifestation entity.
 * If the DOI has been assigned to a particular copy of a manifestation of an expression of the eprint (e.g. it is only intended to resolve to the particular copy of an article as served by a particular Web server), use the DOI as the ''resource URI'' for the Copy entity.

In all cases, the 'http://dx.doi.org/10.100/12345' form of URI encoding should be used.

Note that publisher-assigned DOIs are highly likely to fall into cases 1 or 2.

= A note about mapping the Scholarly Works Application Profile to Simple DC =

http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/repositories/digirep/index/Mapping_the_Scholarly_Works_Application_Profile_to_Simple_DC Mapping the Scholarly Works Application Profile to Simple DC] is available as a separate document.

The mapping enables software to 'dumb-down' (i.e. transform) a ''description set'' that conforms with this application profile to a ''description set'' that conforms with simple DC.  In this context, 'simple DC' means a ''description set'' that comprises a single ''description'' that only uses  the 15 ''properties'' in the [http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/ Dublin Core Metadata Element Set].

It is worth noting that by using this mapping, a ''description set'' that complies with this application profile will be dumbed-down to form a ''description'' that complies with the [http://www.rdn.ac.uk/projects/eprints-uk/docs/simpledc-guidelines/ Using simple DC to describe eprints] document produced by the [http://www.rdn.ac.uk/projects/eprints-uk/ ePrints UK project].

It is also worth noting that the resulting simple DC ''description'' is about the eprint as a ScholarlyWork.  While this is not the only approach to mapping this application profile to simple DC (for example, it would also be possible to map this application profile to a set of simple DC ''descriptions'' about each of the Copy entities) it fits well with the intended usage of this application profile in the [http://www.openarchives.org/ OAI Protocol for Metadata Harvesting].  In this case, each [http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html#Item OAI item] will have associated records that correspond to both the oai_dc format and an XML format based on this application profile.

The particular mapping discussed here and in the separate document does not preclude alternative mappings being generated in the future.
